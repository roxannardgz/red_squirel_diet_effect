# Effect of Diet on Red Squirrel Weight

**Sprint 8: Data Visualization with Python - Tripleten.**


## Introduction

In this study, we examined the relationship between the weight of Red Squirrel and specific diets. The dataset used contains data on 100 red squirrels. These squirrels were assigned to one of three distinct diets right after they stopped nursing, and then their weights as grown adults were measured. The goal of the study was to understand how these different diets might affect the squirrels' adult weights. By looking at this data, we can learn more about how early diet choices might impact animals as they grow up.

## Overview
This project consists of a short EDA and the creation of a simple visualization to represent the distribution of weight of squirrels based on assigned diets. Based on the apparent trend shown in the visualization, we concluded which early diet is more likely to influence the weight of the red squirrels in their adult life. It's worth noting that correlation doesn't imply causation.
